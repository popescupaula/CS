#Importing Compliance Audit Policies
----------------------------------------------------------------------
#About Course:
In this course I will do a sequence of labs, the end goal of which is to develop a Security Benchmarking Tool (SBT). Concretely, I will be work with cyber security audit policies - benchmarks that allow a security offcer to assess a system's vulnerability to different attacks and enforce certain security configurations based on community best practices.

• Language: python3
• Input file: .audit

#Setup
The repository will have a common file where the Tool will be added and separate files with the work steps from each lab.
